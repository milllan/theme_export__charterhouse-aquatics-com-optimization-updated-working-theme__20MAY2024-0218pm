Description of the Service<\/p><p>We have created the Klarna Shopping Service (“the Service”) to give you the best possible shopping experience, regardless if you shop online or in-store. The Service enables an efficient and inspiring shopping experience by offering a range of great benefits. Your shopping experience should have you in focus. That’s why we thought of you when we created the Service and all its benefits. It will simplify purchases, give inspiration and personalized offers, enable control and provide an overview of your shopping.<\/p><p><strong>Product links and links to stores within the Services may be sponsored or affiliated, meaning that Klarna might earn a commission when you shop through those links.<\/strong><\/p><p>The Service includes the following benefits:<\/p><p>1.1 Creation of a Klarna User Account<\/p><p>1.2 Autofill during check out<\/p><p>1.3 Payment methods displayed according to your preferences<\/p><p>1.4 Offers and benefits you actually like<\/p><p>1.5 Remember your selected card<\/p><p>1.6 The Klarna App<\/p><p>1.7 The Klarna Extension<\/p><p>1.8 Sign In With Klarna (“SIWK”)<\/p><p>1.9 Klarna Deals<\/p><p>1.1 Creation of a Klarna User Account<\/p><p>When you sign up to the Service we will create a user account for you, to give you the full potential of all the functions in the Service (“<strong>Klarna User Account<\/strong>”). Remember to always keep your contact information on your Klarna User Account up-to-date and add all your relevant delivery addresses.<\/p><p>You can choose to have your Klarna User Account remembered on a specific device, such as your mobile phone or your tablet (the “Remember me” function). You can do this on one or several of your devices. You should not use this function on shared or public devices. By using this function you will not have to login and authenticate your Klarna User Account each time you use Klarna. This will provide you with a smooth and friction free shopping experience.<\/p><p>The Remember me function places a device identifier, i.e. a “cookie”, on your device. You can delete all cookies on your device, which deletes our cookies as well. For more information, please see our <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.klarna.com\/1.0\/shared\/content\/legal\/terms\/0\/en-uk\/cookie_purchase\" target=\"_blank\">Tracking Technology Notice<\/a>.<\/p><p>1.2 Autofill during check out<\/p><p>In order for you to have a smoooth and friction free shopping experience we will remember some information about you and use that information to autofill different forms with your information during your shopping. This will enable you to save time and focus on more important stuff than filling out the same information over and over again. Let us explain in more detail how this works.<\/p><p><em>Autofill while shopping with Klarna<\/em><\/p><p>When using Klarna the first time you will be asked to create a Klarna User Account to make your future interaction with Klarna smoother. We will keep this information in our systems so that when you return to us or use our Service, you only need to provide some information to us. We will handle all personal information we collect in creating your Klarna User Account in accordance with our <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.klarna.com\/1.0\/shared\/content\/legal\/terms\/0\/en_gb\/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Notice<\/a>.<\/p><p>When we are able to identify you, we may autofill some information about you in the purchase flow, such as name, address, telephone number, email, date of birth and card details. The autofill is based on the information stored on your Klarna User Account. An example of when autofill is used is when you shop directly from the Klarna App.<\/p><p><em>Autofill through input of limited information<\/em><\/p><p>While interacting with Klarna we may ask for information about you, such as name, address, telephone number, email, date of birth, or personal identification number. We will keep this information in our systems so that when you return to us or use our Service, you will only need to provide some of this information such as email and zip-code, or personal identification number (dependent on the country) in order for us to autofill the remaining fields with your other information.<\/p><p><em>Autofill through a Klarna cookie<\/em><\/p><p>An additional method we can use to autofill your information is by placing a Klarna-cookie on your device (computer, tablet, mobile phone, etc.). You may choose to store your information such as name, address, telephone number, email, date of birth, or personal identification number, and card details with Klarna. If you do so, we use the cookie to fetch that information from Klarna’s storage, and the cookie will help us to autofill them when you shop with Klarna.<\/p><p>For more information on our use of cookies see our <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.klarna.com\/1.0\/shared\/content\/legal\/terms\/0\/en_gb\/cookie_purchase\" target=\"_blank\">Cookie Notice<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Disable autofill<\/em><\/p><p>If you don’t want to use the Autofill functionalities you can contact us and we will disable them. You can also disable them from the Klarna App or by adjusting your autofill settings during the purchase process. You can at any given time delete all cookies on your device, which deletes our cookie as well.<\/p><p>1.3 Payment methods displayed according to your preferences<\/p><p>We will arrange the order of your payment methods based on different factors:<\/p><ul><li>If you have chosen a payment method as your preference<\/li><li>If you have previously used a specific payment method<\/li><li>If we are required by law to show payment methods in a certain order.<\/li><\/ul><p>This does not affect which payment methods are available to you, only the order in which we present them.<\/p><p>1.4 Offers and benefits you actually like<\/p><p>Klarna may present offers and benefits such as discounts, special events, priority access to products, sales promotions, store offers, samples and gifts. The offers and benefits given to you are based on, among other things, the number of purchases, the amount you have spent and\/or your usage of Klarna’s services or features. In some cases of such offers and benefits, specific terms and conditions may apply. These will be provided to you in conjunction with the offer or benefit.<\/p><p>1.5 Remember your selected card<\/p><p>When you make a purchase with Klarna, you can use several different payment options, including debit, credit, or prepaid cards. If you have chosen to pay by card, we will keep your card details until you choose to delete the information or until you close your Klarna User Account. By choosing to save your card details with Klarna, you agree to Klarna charging the saved card for later purchases with Klarna. You will not be charged until you make a purchase. If the card you have chosen by default cannot be charged for a purchase, including instalment plans or subscriptions, you agree that Klarna will try to charge one of the other cards you have registered in your Klarna User Account.<\/p><p>1.6 The Klarna App<\/p><p>The Klarna App is an application accessible via your mobile devices or the web portal in your browser and is your shopping assistant. By using the Klarna App you can pay for your purchases, track your packages, get shopping tips and many more things. Some of these features are activated by downloading the Klarna App or logging in at the web portal, while others can be activated by you after login. Klarna wants to provide you with the best shopping experience and offer you the ability to search for a wide range of stores in the Klarna App. We may not have a commercial relationship with all stores shown or searchable in the Klarna App. In these cases, Klarna acts like a web browser or search engine, thereby just redirecting you to the store’s website in the integrated web browser. The exact content of features can differ between the country you use it in. To mention a few of the features we are most proud of:<\/p><ul><li>View your Klarna purchases and transactions<\/li><li>Manage your payments<\/li><li>Easy interaction with Klarna<\/li><li>Personalised recommendations, offers and other contentExample of other features we may offer depending on the country version:<\/li><li>Shopping services like search and compare functions including a shopping assistant chatbot that you can ask questions about products and that can help you find the right products, an in-app browser, an overview of stores that we think you will like<\/li><li>Shop using Klarna’s payment methods - even at stores which do not yet use Klarna<\/li><li>Order, delivery, or parcel tracking<\/li><li>Connect your email or third-party accounts to view your orders made via stores or entities unrelated to Klarna<\/li><li>Easy return handling and refunds<\/li><li>Personal finance overview and management, for example, however not limited to: overview of monthly budget and spending, visualisation of the consumer’s balances (e.g. the consumer’s savings or purchases), and other spending insights<\/li><li>Display and store your transactions, purchases, receipts, images and other shopping related information<\/li><li>CO2 emission footprint on your purchases<\/li><li>Image product search, allowing you to take a photo of a product and then browse similar products<\/li><li>Create and share collections of goods or services of your choice<\/li><li>Share your transactions with other Klarna users<\/li><li>Share your experience and thoughts with others on stores and products you purchased by submitting a review<\/li><li>An assistant that suggests helping you to fill in various information (such as payment method, card details, shipping address) by use of autofill (“<strong>Smart Suggestions<\/strong>”).

You acknowledge and agree that your use of the third-party resell platform will be governed by that platform’s terms and conditions.

The terms and conditions (“Extension Terms”) in this Section 1.8 are only applicable to your (hereinafter “Extension User” or \"you\") use of the Klarna Extension.<\/p><p>The Klarna Extension applies assorted discount coupons on the online-store presence of merchants collaborating with and selected by Klarna (\"<strong>Affiliate Stores<\/strong>\"). Klarna receives fees for referring our Klarna Extension users to Affiliated Stores, and Klarna uses a portion of those fees to pay for gift cards earned by our users through accruing points on Qualifying Purchases. A \"<strong>Qualifying Purchase<\/strong>\" shall be those purchases where the Affiliate Store offers points on the purchase. <\/p><p>The Affiliate Stores available through the Klarna Extension are entirely at the discretion of Klarna and may vary from time to time. <\/p><p>Any purchases that you make are directly from Affiliate Stores and not from Klarna. The Affiliate Store’s terms and conditions shall apply to purchases made on its site and Klarna shall not have any liability in relation to any products or services that you purchase.<\/p><p>We have no control over the contents of Affiliate Stores' websites.<\/p><p>Additional features in the Klarna Extension are usable subject to an additional login into the Klarna Extension (see further descriptions below).<\/p><p><em>1.7.2 General Information, Eligibility<\/em><\/p><p>Klarna Extension can be used on Google Chrome and other supported web browsers from time to time. The technical usability of Klarna Extension on third party web browsers is subject to the respective usage terms of these browsers and the technical limitations and specifications of any device on which Klarna Extension is to be installed.<\/p><p>An Extension User must be at least 18 (eighteen) years old and have a European phone number to use the Klarna Extension, in addition to the eligibility requirements and Extension Terms set forth below. By installing, activating, enabling, using, or otherwise accessing the Klarna Extension, you confirm that you are 18 years old or over and that these Extension Terms will govern your use of the Klarna Extension.<\/p><p><em>1.7.3 Klarna Extension Functions and Limitations<\/em><\/p><p>The Klarna Extension offers several features, some of which are only accessible to an Extension User after first registering for a Klarna Extension account. These features are split into basic functions, each a “<strong>Basic Function<\/strong>”, and enhanced functions, each an “<strong>Enhanced Function<\/strong>”. Klarna updates the Klarna Extension continuously with new and improved features and reserves the right to withdraw any of the Basic Functions or Enhanced Functions at any time.<\/p><p><em>1.7.4 Enhanced Functions Prerequisite<\/em><\/p><p>In order to use the Enhanced Functions, the Extension User must first create a Klarna User Account. To create a Klarna User Account, you are required to provide your contact information, e.g. a valid email address, postal address and\/or an EU phone number. Klarna reserves the right to verify your eligibility to create a Klarna User Account. <\/p><p><em>1.7.5 Klarna Extension Basic Functions<\/em><\/p><p>If the store you visit is one of our Affiliate Stores, when you reach the Affiliate Store’s checkout you will be notified in the browser if there are coupons available and offered the opportunity to activate the coupons. If you choose to view the available coupons, the Basic Function will then show you available coupons for the Affiliate Store.<\/p><p>All coupons and discounts are provided by the Affiliate Store. Coupon terms are subject to the relevant Affiliate Store’s terms and conditions. Klarna always strives to provide you with accurate coupons. However, we do not warrant or guarantee the availability of coupons or that any of the coupons or discounts are accurate, complete, up to date or error free or that any such coupons or discounts will offer the lowest price for an item. Klarna may earn a commission from your transaction.<\/p><p>Examples of other Basic Function(s) that may be available to you depending on your country’s version of the Klarna Extension include the following:<\/p><ul><li>Create and share collections of goods or services of your choice (wishlists).<\/li><li>Our price compare tool. The price compare tool searches for better prices on the relevant Amazon website by comparing sellers for you. <strong>Please note that Amazon and Klarna are not affiliated.<\/strong> Prices on Amazon may change, and the results of our price comparison tool are valid only at the time the comparison is made. Klarna does not become a party to any agreement that you conclude with Amazon and is also not liable for any issues arising from contractual relationships existing between you and third parties<strong>. <\/strong>Klarna always strives to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible. However, we gather information from public-domain sources. Our intention is that all the information in relation to the price compare tool should be accurate and up to date. However, we cannot guarantee the reliability or the accuracy of the information.<\/li><\/ul><p><em>Klarna Reward<\/em><\/p><p>This function permits an Extension User to accrue points on Qualifying Purchases into a dedicated Klarna User Account within the Klarna Extension (“<strong>Points<\/strong>”). One Point will be the equivalent of GBP 1. The number of Points accrued on a Qualifying Purchase may be set individually by each Affiliate Store and may be changed by each Affiliate Store from time to time. <\/p><p>Points can be collected by following the process set out below. You do not need to log in to the Klarna Extension at the time of purchase to collect Points, but in order to see your current Points balance or redeem such amount (subject to these Extension Terms) you need to be logged in and provide us with your name, email, and postal address - unless you have already provided that information to Klarna. <\/p><p>Points are accrued on the net purchase amount. The net purchase amount for determining Points excludes taxes, fees, shipping, gift-wrapping, returns or cancellations, and extended warranties.<\/p><p>Points may not be allocated if all or part of your order is returned, amended or cancelled. <\/p><p>In order to earn and redeem Points, the following steps must be taken: <\/p><ul><li>Points are only earned by making online purchases of Qualifying Purchases at Affiliate Stores. Affiliate Stores may exclude certain products and purchases from the Klarna Reward Enhanced Function.<\/li><li>The availability of Points for a particular Qualifying Purchase will be shown in the Klarna Extension. The Klarna Extension will show the number of Points available during the specific Extension User’s Shopping Session. A “<strong>Shopping Session”<\/strong> describes the uninterrupted process of product selection until payment for the Qualifying Purchase is completed on an Affiliate Store’s website.<\/li><li>Once an Extension User has reached an Affiliate Store’s checkout during a Shopping Session, the Extension User may activate Points by clicking the relevant button. The Affiliate Store’s terms and conditions shall apply to purchases made on its site.<\/li><li>After activating Points, an Extension User must complete the purchase in the same Shopping Session to accrue Points.<\/li><li>Points cannot be redeemed retrospectively against any item(s) which you have already purchased.<\/li><li>An Extension User must ensure that all technical criteria are met in order to activate and claim Points, including having cookies and java script enabled on your web browser.<\/li><li>You will need to log in to your Klarna User Account from the device used for the Shopping Session within fourteen (14) days of completing each Shopping Session so that we can allocate Points to your Klarna User Account.<\/li><li>A Points figure that was correctly obtained during a Shopping Session will be credited to a Klarna User Account within thirty (30) days after an Affiliate Store’s (contractual and\/or statutory return policy i.e. as long as you can return the item or service you bought) period expires. During the return policy period the Points are categorised as <em>Pending<\/em>.<\/li><li>The Extension User needs to collect a total amount of 25 Points (minimum) in order to redeem the Points for a gift card (the “<strong>Payout Threshold<\/strong>”). You must have the number of Points required for a gift card in your Klarna User Account at the time of redemption. You cannot redeem Points which have not yet been credited to your Klarna User Account.<\/li><li>Subject to any other requirement in these Extension Terms, once the Extension User has reached the Payout Threshold, we will send an email to the Extension User’s registered email containing a redemption code that the Extension User may use to redeem the Points as a gift card. More information on how you do this is provided in the email you receive. Klarna may modify or add gift card providers at its discretion. The gift cards are subject to terms and conditions of the gift card provider and the relevant merchant if specified. If you have any questions related to the gift cards, you can contact our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klarna.com\/uk\/customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\">customer service<\/a> and we will assist you further.<\/li><li>Klarna sends emails with an offer to redeem the Extension User’s Points on a quarterly basis. Provided that you have at least 25 Points in your Klarna User Account available for redemption, you will be offered the chance to redeem your Points during the next available period. Klarna is not responsible for lost email or any other event or delay beyond the control of Klarna.<\/li><\/ul><p>Once you have reached the Payout Threshold and we have sent you a redemption code, the redeemed Points will no longer be available in your Klarna User Account and your Points balance will be adjusted to reflect the same. <\/p><p>You will be responsible for selecting a gift card. Klarna will not have any responsibility for any error you make in selecting a gift card and\/or your use of that gift card.<\/p><p>Points:<\/p><ul><li>Can only be earned, retained or redeemed as set out in these Extension Terms;<\/li><li>Cannot be used as any form of credit, debit or for any other purpose;<\/li><li>Can only be redeemed for gift cards as set out in these Extension Terms; they have no redeemable cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash;<\/li><li>Cannot be sold, transferred or exchanged (to other Klarna User Account or otherwise) or used for any other purpose, except as specified in these Extension Terms or otherwise in writing by Klarna; and<\/li><li>Are personal to your Klarna User Account and cannot be pooled with the Points earned by another person and\/or redeemed together.<\/li><\/ul><p>If someone else accesses your Klarna User Account, then you may lose Points earned.<\/p><p>You can check your Points balance on your Klarna User Account at any point by logging in to your Klarna User Account in your Klarna Extension. If you decide to check your balance, you will be responsible for all connection and\/or data charges you incur in doing so. Please note also that we will not be responsible for any communication failure arising from events outside of our control which, for example (but without limitation), results in you being unable to check your Points balance or your Points balance not updating or being slow to update. You can also confirm your Points balance at any time by contacting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klarna.com\/uk\/customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\">customer service<\/a>. <\/p><p>We reserve the right to correct or amend Points balances in your Klarna User Account or to suspend redemption codes if Points have been allocated to you in error or we reasonably consider that there has been a misuse of the Klarna Extension or an error has occurred. If you wish to query such a correction or amendment to your Points balance or suspension of a redemption code, please contact our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klarna.com\/uk\/customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\">customer service<\/a>.<\/p><p>Klarna reserves the right to limit or terminate your Klarna User Account (including without limitation by terminating the collection of Points and\/or redemption of gift cards) and\/or take any other action we consider appropriate if we reasonably suspect that you are not eligible to participate in the Enhanced Functions under these Extension Terms, there is misconduct, fraudulent, unauthorised or inappropriate use of your Klarna User Account (including without limitation tampering with or duplicating Points), you have provided us with false or misleading information or you have otherwise not complied with these Extension Terms.<\/p><p><em>One-time Card<\/em><\/p><p>One additional<strong> <\/strong>Enhanced Function is the use of the One-time Card Service - one of Klarna’s available payment services.

You won't have to remember individual usernames and passwords for each app or service. These third-party apps and services are provided by companies other than Klarna.

At some third-parties or services you will also have the option to share additional information at your choice. The shared data will be used by the third-party to check if you already have an existing account at the third-party and connect to it if that’s the case. If you don’t have an account on the third-party app or service the shared data will instead be used to facilitate the account creation at the third-party. If you use SIWK on a third-party app or service Klarna will continuously share the information you have approved with the third party. For example if you update the information in your Klarna User Account, Klarna will share these updates with the third-party app or service. Depending on the third-party app or service functionality enabled, SIWK might also automatically log you into your Klarna account when making a purchase with the third-party app, eliminating the necessity for a manual login through a separate authentication method.<\/p><p>You have the option to withdraw the third-party app's authorization to receive information from your Klarna User Account whenever you wish. This can be done through the Klarna App or by getting in touch with our customer service. Please note that this withdrawal for Klarna to share information will not affect the account at the third-party. <\/p><p>When you use SIWK, Klarna does not receive access to your third-party account, nor does the third-party receive access to your Klarna User account.<\/p><p>Important: In addition to data shared by Klarna the third-party might request for additional information directly from you. This additional information will not be shared with Klarna. All information will be used by the third-party app or service as described in their privacy notice or elsewhere. Make sure to read them before you start using SIWK on a specific third-party.<\/p><p>1.9 Klarna Deals<\/p><p>Klarna may offer you discounts when paying with Pay Now, Pay Later and Pay in 4\/3 at Klarna’s partner stores’ checkout (‘Klarna Deal’).<\/p><p>Klarna Deal is a discount offered by Klarna that will be automatically applied at checkout when paying with Klarna at Klarna’s partner stores (stores that offer Klarna as a payment option) through their websites or in the Klarna App. The Klarna Deals are not available through any third party websites or apps.<\/p><p>Each Klarna Deals are subject to specific conditions, such as the discount percentage or amount, how to redeem it and the promotion period (‘Klarna Deal Terms’).You may access the Klarna Deal Terms via email, Klarna purchase flow or in the Klarna App.<\/p><p>The Klarna Deal will apply to any Klarna Payment method available at the partner stores’ checkout, excluding the One-time Card.
